# RideHailing Ethereum Smart Contract

This is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain. It's a ride-hailing smart contract similar to Uber, but decentralized.

## Overview

The `RideHailing` contract allows users to request, accept, complete, and cancel rides. Each ride has a fare which is calculated based on the distance of the ride.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
    git clone .git
2. Install the required Node.js packages:
    npm install
3. Compile the contract:
    npx hardhat compile
4. Run tests:
    npx hardhat test
5. You can also deploy the contract to a local Hardhat Network:
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
